Sentiment Analysis
This sentiment analysis project utilized natural language processing techniques and the NLTK module to analyze sentiments in airline user tweets and movie reviews. By implementing data pre-processing techniques such as stop word removal and feature extraction, the text data was refined for sentiment classification. Leveraging machine learning algorithms and Python programming, sentiment patterns were discerned, and insights were gained into the sentiments expressed in the analyzed texts. The project also employed data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn libraries to effectively communicate findings. Overall, this project demonstrated proficiency in NLP, machine learning, data pre-processing, Python programming, and data visualization, contributing to a deeper understanding of sentiment analysis in textual data.
